# Project 1: Fraud Detection in Online Transactions (Best Model with Pickle Saving)
Project Name: Fraud Detection in Online Transactions (Best Model)
Description: This project aims to detect fraudulent online transactions by training various machine learning models and evaluating their performance. The best performing model will be saved using the pickle module, making it ready for later use in real-time applications for fraud detection.

Objective:
To build and evaluate various machine learning models for fraud detection in online transactions.
To select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
To save the selected model as a pickle file for later use.

# Project 2: Fraud Detection with SMOTE Analysis
Project Name: Fraud Detection in Online Transactions (SMOTE Analysis)
Description: In this project, the goal is to detect fraudulent transactions using machine learning models. SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is applied to balance the dataset and address class imbalance, which is a common issue in fraud detection tasks.

Objective:
To apply SMOTE for handling class imbalance in the dataset.
